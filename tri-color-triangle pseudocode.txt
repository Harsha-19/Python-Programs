Step 1: Initialize the Turtle and Screen
        Set up the turtle and screen.

Turtle:    Initialized at the center of the screen.
Screen:    Background is set to black.
Pen Width: Set to 2.
Speed:     Set to maximum.

Step 2: Define Colors
Action: Create a list of colors ('white', 'pink', 'cyan').


Step 3: Start the Loop (Iterate 150 Times)
Action: Begin a loop that will run 150 times.

Pen Color:    Set based on the current index.
Move Forward: Distance increases with each iteration.
Turn Right:   By 121 degrees.

Step 4: Draw the Spiral
        Continue the loop, creating a spiral pattern.

Color Change:  The pen color alternates every few segments.
Spiral Growth: The spiral grows outward, with each line segment getting longer.

Step 5:  Resulting Pattern
         After 150 iterations, the final spiral pattern emerges.

Pattern: The spiral has alternating colors (white, pink, cyan) and grows larger 
as the turtle moves further from the center.
